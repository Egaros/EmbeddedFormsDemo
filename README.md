# EmbeddedFormsDemo

A simple demonstration app to show how to embed Xamarin.Forms pages 
into a native app.

The app jut starts up as a native app, but then when you tap the
login button, it initializes Xamarin.Forms and shows a `ContentPage`.

This code goes with my blog post showing how to do this, along with 
some extra information that I am sure will be helpful:
